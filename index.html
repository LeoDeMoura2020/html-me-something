				<h2>Love</h2>
				<p>It is not every year you meet the person want to spend your life with. I was fortunate enough to find
					mine recently.
					What I could never have imagined is that this person was born and raised over 6,000 miles away from
					me, in a different continent.
					After changing our lives to be together, my trip to Poland showed me it was the best decision of my life.
					I am from Brazil, she is from Poland and we met here in the United States. This multi cultural
					relationship is one of our many strenghts and allow us to put in practice the best of those worlds.

				<h2>History</h2>
				<p>To my surprise, Poland has one of the most interesting history I have ever studied.
					Founded in 966 when Duke Mieszko I was converted to Christianity, Poland has seen more changes in
					its territory that I could count.
					Dating back to the medieval times, it has seen different kings for centuries , disappeared from the
					map for over one hundred years, was devastated by Germany and Russia during WWII and defeated
					Comunism in the 80`s.
					To learn about histoy and geography is my favourite thing during any trip and Poland showed me I
					could learn something new every single day.

				<h2>Science</h2>
				<p>Little do we know how many awesome scientists were actually born in Poland. From Nicolau Copernicus to Daniel
					Gabriel Fahrenheit, Warner Brothers or Ignacy Łukasiewiczin , who built the first oil refinery.
					During more recent times some examples are Marie Curie or the Enigma codebreakers Marian Rejewski, Henryk Zygalski and
					Jerzy Różycki.
					In whatever field, Polish scientists have contributted tremendously to the world`s development.

				<a name="religion"></a>
				<h2>Religion</h2>
				<p>The most practiced religion is Roman Catholicism, whose followers comprised around 90% of the
					population. Catholics make the most significant religious group and this religion is a subject
					studied at school, even though this is not obligatory.
					The most esteemed person for many Poles was John Paul II, the Polish Pope. His popularity is based
					upon his many pilgrimages and his open attitude towards people, and among the youth he often
					surpassed the fame of current singers and actors.
					"The Pope" as he is still known until today, has played an important role in the fall of communism
					in Poland.
