		<h2>Love</h2>
		<p>Though most of my extended family is from Missouri, I was born in Boulder, Colorado, at Boulder County Hospital.
		My mother lived in Boulder for a few years in the early 1980s, but we returned to Missouri early enough in my live that I don't have any recollection of living there.
		Still, it's a beautiful place that I still like to claim as my original home. 
		We returned frequently over the years to visit family friends, and to explore Boulder Canyon and nearby Rocky Mountain National Park.</p>
